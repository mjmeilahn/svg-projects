# SVG Projects
One repo that contains a list of my SVG pet projects.

1. Basics - Observing HTML attributes of different shapes within a SVG. Includes shapes, positioning and fills.

2. Line Animation - Exploring drawing a logo. Simple SVG dash-offset and rotate animation.

3. CSS Animation properties - Understanding CSS properties and how they are configured for animating all kinds of SVG shapes. Keyframes using either FROM/TO or percentages.
