# SVG Projects
One repo that contains a list of my SVG pet projects.

1. Basics - Observing HTML attributes of different shapes within a SVG. Includes shapes, positioning and fills.

2. Line Animation - Exploring drawing a logo. Simple SVG dash-offset and rotate animation.

3. CSS Animation properties - Understanding CSS properties and how they are configured for animating all kinds of SVG shapes. Keyframes using either FROM/TO or percentages.

4. Cursive Animation - Taking a simple hand-drawn SVG and animating a "signature".

5. Social Icons - Exploring simple Social Media icon animations using past projects as reference.

6. Gradients - Applying simple stop tags to defs for a linear gradient on text and shapes.

7. Textures - Exploring images behind SVG shapes & text.

8. Masks - Animating an infinite mask moving left to right over SVG shapes & text.
